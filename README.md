# Simple-Network-Project
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer.   The goal is to connect two departments — ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY — using proper subnetting, routing, and device configuration, and to verify end-to-end connectivity between them.
